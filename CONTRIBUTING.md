To keep the codebase clean, consistent, and maintainable, please follow these guidelines:

## Code Quality

- **Tests**: Run all tests before submitting code. Make sure your changes do not break existing tests and add new ones if needed.
- **Type Checking**: Use `pyright` in **strict** mode. All code should pass without errors.

## Style and Formatting

- Format code with **ruff**.
- Follow the general style conventions:
  - Use **absolute imports**.
  - Keep code **readable** â€“ prefer clarity over cleverness.

## Issues

If you're planning a non-trivial contribution, please open an issue first to discuss the idea. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures alignment with the project's direction.
